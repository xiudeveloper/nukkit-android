# nukkit-android
Nukkit for Android, using the Andronix project.

# Installation
First, you should install Curl to your Andronix machine. Run the following command:
```bash
apt update && apt upgrade -y && apt install curl -y
```
Now run the following command in your Andronix Ubuntu:
```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xiudeveloper/nukkit-android/main/install.sh && chmod +x install.sh && ./install.sh && rm -r install.sh
```
# Connection
You need basic linux knowledge to be able to connect to the server. I will not provide help unless it is related to a bug.
